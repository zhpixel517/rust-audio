Right now this is just a program that plays back what the computer hears in the microphone. 
My end goal is to create a VOIP application, and this is how I've been practicing. I'll apply the lessons I learn here to the real application. 
(This is also why I've encoded samples with `opus`, even though it isn't doing any network transmission yet.)
